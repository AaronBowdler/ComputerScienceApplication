        <h1>Motherboard</h1>

        <p>A motherboard is one of the most essential parts of a computer system. It holds together many of the crucial components of a computer,
		including the central processing unit (CPU), memory and connectors for input and output devices.
		The base of a motherboard consists of a very firm sheet of non-conductive material,
		typically some sort of rigid plastic. Thin layers of copper or aluminum foil, referred to as traces, are printed onto this sheet.
		These traces are very narrow and form the circuits between the various components.
                In addition to circuits, a motherboard contains a number of sockets and slots to connect the other components.NAS stands for Network Attached Storage.
                 It allows you to connect large amounts of storage directly to a broadband router. Therefore, this storage is available for all devices.
                 The NAS drive is designed to be permanently open, which means you can access music, movies, photos and documents at any time
        </p><p> All of the slots and plugs both inside and outside the computer case are shaped a certain way to accept a certain type of part.
                  Some will not even accept parts even one generation behind, such as the CPU and memory. Others, like the video plug have not changed in years.
                   Some of the plugs, such as the video, keyboard and mouse plugs, are a special color. These colors make it easier to pair the plug to the port.
                    The motherboard is also referred to as the PCB which stands for ‘printed circuit board’.</p>
