        <h1>Peripherals</h1>

        <p>A peripheral device is "an ancillary device used to put information into and get information out of the computer.”
Two categories of peripheral devices exist based on their relationship with the computer:
an input device sends data or instructions to the computer, such as a mouse, keyboard, graphics tablet, image scanner, barcode reader, game controller, light pen, light gun, microphone, digital camera, webcam, dance pad, and read-only memory
an output device provides output from the computer, such as a computer monitor, projector, printer, headphones, and computer speaker
Many modern electronic devices, such as digital watches, smartphones, and tablet computers, have interfaces that allow them to be used as computer peripheral devices. However some people are worried
that people spend too much time on computers and can get illnesses from them such as Overuse injuries of the hand, Obesity, Muscle and joint problems, Eyestrain and
Behavioural problems including aggressive behaviour. this is because if prolonged use of laptop computers is common, and therefore dangers to one's health from computer radiation are quite real.
 Exposure to large amounts of electromagnetic radiation can cause meaningful damage to healthy cells and chromosome damage.
 Cloud storage involves stashing data on hardware in a remote physical location, which can be accessed from any device via the internet.
  Clients send files to a data server maintained by a cloud provider instead of (or as well as) storing it on their own hard drives. Some of the 
  dangers of storage clouds are that from security holes to support issues, below are eight risks all users take when migrating to and storing their data in the cloud.
  Someone else is looking after your data. Cyberattacks, Insider threats, Government intrusion, Legal liability, Lack of standardization, Lack of support,  There's always a risk.
  However, Cloud computing is much different the, Cloud computing is practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
