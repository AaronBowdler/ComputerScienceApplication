        <h1>CPU</h1>

        <p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic,
		controlling and input/output operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.
		 Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU),
                 distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.The performance of the CPU is affected by the number of cores,
                  clock speed and memory.The spesifications for typical entry, mid and advanced levels of a PC is - Processor - dual core at 2.4 GHz (i5 or i7 Intel processor or equivalent AMD)
                   RAM - 8 GB. Hard Drive - 320 GB 5400 RPM hard drive.
        </p><p>Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine"
                   which "creates the illusion to users of a very large memory.For example, an eight-core chip with three levels may include an L1 cache for each core,
                    one intermediate L2 cache for each pair of cores, and one L3 cache shared between all cores.
                     Shared highest-level cache, which is called before accessing memory, is usually referred to as the last level cache (LLC).
                     cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster;
                      the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.
                       A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot.
                        Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store;
                         thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.</p>
